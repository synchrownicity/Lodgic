## **Project Overview**

*Lodgic* is an interactive web application built using **RShiny**, designed to support data-driven decision-making in Singapore's vacation rental market. The platform serves two primary user groups:

| User Group | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Travellers | Discover listings based on price, room type and proximity to key amenities | 
| Property Owners | Gain insights into local pricing dynamics, demand distribution, and market competition |

Travellers often struggle to find Airbnb listings that align with their specific preferences, while property owners lack access to detailed market intelligence, making it difficult to identify under-served or oversaturated areas.

*Lodgic* addresses these challenges by offering a **centralised, interactive platform** that combines **data visualisation** and **insight-driven analytics** to help both travellers and hosts to make smarter, faster and more informed decisions.
